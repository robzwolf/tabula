/**
 * Location represents a single location on the board, but not its position
 * Locations on the main part of the board may only contain a single colour of piece.
 *
 * Off-board locations, i.e. the starting location, the finishing location and the knocked-off location
 * can contain pieces of both colours and are referred to as mixed.
 *
 * Requires a constructor with one parameter (the name of the location), which creates a non-mixed location with no pieces.
